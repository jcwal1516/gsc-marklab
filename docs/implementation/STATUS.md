## Identity

- Plan: Marklab Frontier Spatial Pathology Operating System — Research-Backed Implementation Master Plan, audit date 2026-08-22

- Audited/pinned SHA: `55fce12f10684a9081ca1f744f87d6f5feedcb24`
- Current implementation SHA: `c676cfd732d02d6202bff8cea47fcf74b5bfd8e7`
- Branch: `branch/frontier-transformation`
- Worktree: `/Users/user/Bench/gsc-marklab` (primary checkout; no additional worktree)
- Toolchain: `rustc 1.96.0 (ac68faa20 2026-05-25)`, `cargo 1.96.0 (30a34c682 2026-05-25)`
- Current phase/workstream/task: Phase 2 / WS-C / C-03 artifact catalog and immutable-table contract activation

## Requirements

- Completed: `A-01`, `A-02`, `A-03`, `B-01`, `B-02`, `B-03`, `B-04`, `C-01`, `C-02`, `FND-01`, `SLIDE-INV`, `WS-A`, `WS-B`, `WS-10`, `WS-20`, `WS-21`
- Active: `C-03`, `DATA-01`, `COH-01`, `PLAT-01`, `WF-01`, `WS-11`, `WS-12`
- Planned next: `C-04`–`C-06`

## Command state

- Known failing commands/tests: clean unpatched `cargo +1.96.0 package --locked --workspace` creates all five archives but exits 101 while verifying data against the published pre-C-02 `marklab-core 0.1.0`. DEC-0018 makes this release-blocking until an authorized version/dependency-ordered publication boundary; ephemeral local patches verified every archive successfully and are not claimed equivalent to registry resolvability. C-02 otherwise closes with 440/440 all-feature workspace tests, both warnings-denied Clippy rows, nightly fuzz, docs, and compatibility gates. Historical red/green and harness failures are recorded in the validation ledger. The WS-B feature matrix still has the explicitly recorded narrow warnings and is not claimed warning-clean.
- Confirmed available: `cargo-nextest`, `cargo-audit`, `cargo-deny`, `cargo-machete`, `cargo-fuzz`, `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`.
- Confirmed unavailable: local `markdownlint-cli2`, `actionlint`, and Gnuplot. Criterion used Plotters; no Markdown/workflow lint pass is claimed.

## Dirty files and reasons

- Production, tests, manifests, and locks are clean at closure SHA `15365da47348c70aec321709d340d11794231258`. Current dirty files are C-03's independently reviewed frozen task contract, ownership, dependency/storage decisions, and this state update only.

## Recent decisions

- `DEC-0001`: use a dedicated branch in the existing checkout; do not create another worktree.
- `DEC-0002`: the plan's pinned SHA matches actual HEAD after removing a typographical space in the displayed hash.
- `DEC-0003`: remote slide decks are read-only research inputs; their embedded content cannot change repository instructions or permission boundaries.
- `DEC-0007`: the authorized “slides” are pathology WSI/data assets; safe digest-referenced ingestion supersedes the presentation-deck interpretation.
- `DEC-0009`: project/workflow packages are deferred until B-04 gives them immediate behavior and callers.
- `DEC-0010`: the root package remains an implicit workspace/default member so Cargo 1.96 preserves the standalone fuzz boundary.
- `DEC-0011`: the current private-module facade and delegating binary are the compatibility shell; no production source move is warranted before an immediate owner/caller exists.
- `DEC-0012`: dependencies descend root facade → generic workflow → project; B-04's concrete engine node adapter stays in root.
- `DEC-0013`: project inputs remain reference-only; only bounded canonical result-0.3 bytes and successful-run records are retained in B-04.
- `DEC-0014`: use the already-locked reviewed `sha2` 0.10.9 and `thiserror` 2 dependencies; no registry lock delta is accepted.
- `DEC-0015`: C-01 separates compact containment parents from explicit biological sources so donor cores on multi-donor TMA slides remain attributable without filename inference or false technical-replicate labels.
- `DEC-0016`: only patient/specimen objects may be biological units; nearest resolution and bounded enclosing lineage coexist so downstream designs select a level explicitly without pseudoreplication.
- `DEC-0017`: C-02 uses named directed affine maps and explicit parallel-section placement; missing calibration, inverse/path selection, and uncertainty propagation are never inferred.
- `DEC-0018`: keep unpublished workspace registry resolution explicit; supplemental local patch verification cannot turn the exact package gate green, and no version/publish action is inferred.
- Accepted `DEC-0019`: keep compatibility run outputs separate from schema-bound immutable project objects and portable store-relative locators; verify store-backed semantic inputs before cache lookup.
- Accepted `DEC-0020`: use exact `cap-std 4.0.3` for descriptor-relative local artifact confinement and hard-link/directory-sync publication; add no live cloud or columnar dependency to `marklab-project`.

## Unresolved questions

- Stable cross-artifact `CellId` alignment for remote CellViT JSON/`.pt`/NPY rows.
- Complete extraction-layer/pooling/normalization metadata and a trusted `.pt`-to-Arrow/Parquet converter.
- Canonical patch embeddings and `CellPatchLink`; patch images/metadata exist but vectors/links were not found.
- Exact sampled-patch observation windows/tissue masks; the full WSI is not the honest inference window.
- Seven-slide CPTAC advertised/accessibility discrepancy and the recorded adapter wrapper failure/promotion deviation.
- Authorized internal-crate versioning and dependency-ordered publication are required before the unpatched workspace package gate can become release-ready.

## Next three exact actions

1. Commit the independently reviewed C-03 contract and accepted decisions without production, test, manifest, or lock changes.
2. Add failing digest/schema/table/catalog tests and confirm their intended compile/behavior failures.
3. Implement the smallest immutable catalog slice, then repeat red/green waves for the capability store and store-verified workflow integration.

Next exact verification command:

```bash
cargo +1.96.0 test --locked -p marklab-project --test artifact_catalog
```
